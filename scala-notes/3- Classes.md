```scala
class Employee(firstName:String, lastName:String)
```

- public keyword not required because everythin public as default
- ```scalac Employee.scala``` -> will generate .class file
- (firstName:String, lastName:String) -> constructor 

```scala
class Employee(val firstName:String, lastName:String)
```

```scala
val ada = new Employee("Ada", "Surname")
println(ada.firstName)
```

ada.firstName -> actually is a get method, not direct access

```scala -cp EmployeeScript.scala```
