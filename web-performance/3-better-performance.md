#### How we can Fix Paint Flashing?

- Transform and opacity css could be used in separate layer than layout frame. IT is composite layer
    - Use will-change in css
    - RequestAnimationFrame

`element.style.top = serviceHeight * currentPosition / bodyHeight + "px";`
to   
`element.style.transform = "translateY("+ serviceHeight * currentPosition / bodyHeight + "px" + ")";`


`.services__overlay {
    â€¦
    will-change: transform;
}`
